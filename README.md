# semantic-bi
Please read Datastore.pdf for an introduction to the project.
The project intends to leverage a custom or existing ESB deployment (Apache Service Mix / JBoss Fuse) with a semantic web (RDF, OWL) augmented MDM (Master Data Management) BI component backend for integration, rules, workflow and events (CEP) management services.

All this in a Big Data / Linked Data paradigm which comprises new techniques for ontology modelling. Services are to be provided for consumption and exposition of knowledge base component.
